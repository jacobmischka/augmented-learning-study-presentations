## Apple

_Malus pumila_

Found in Kazakhstan as early as 328 BCE; likely the earliest tree to be cultivated

More than 7500 known cultivars

```notes
The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Significant exchange with crabapples has resulted in modern apples being more related to crabapples than their original ancestor.

Another somewhat interesting fact is that Red Delicious apples are in fact not delicious, but terrible.

## Orange

_Citrus × sinensis_ (also known as the _Citrus aurantium_ Sour Orange Group)

Earliest mention in Chinese literature from 314 BC

Hybrid between pomelo and mandarin

```notes
As of 1987, found to be the most cultivated fruit tree in the world.

The fruit of any citrus tree is considered a hesperidium, a kind of modified berry.

## Pear

Genus _Pyrus_

Evidence of being eaten since prehistoric times, cultivated in China for approximately 3000 years

Around 3000 varieties, many not actually "pear-shaped"

```notes
Unlike modern apples and oranges, it's a naturally occurring fruit, so people have essentially always eaten it.

While many pears bear a strong resemblence to apples, one major difference is that the flesh of pear fruit contains __stone cells__ (aka "grit").

## Banana

_Musa × paradisiaca_

First cultivation in Papua New Guinea between 8000-5000 BCE

Actually a berry

```notes
Complicated and interesting history of taxonomy. Originally placed into two groups (dessert bananas and plantains), then reclassified several times based on ancestral or morphological characteristics. As a result, lots of confusion over the "official" scientific names.
