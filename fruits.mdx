## Pear

Genus _Pyrus_

Evidence of being eaten since prehistoric times, cultivated in China for approximately 3000 years

## Banana

_Musa × paradisiaca_

First cultivation in Papua New Guinea between 8000-5000 BCE

Actually a berry

```notes
Complicated and interesting history of taxonomy. Originally placed into two groups (dessert bananas and plantains), then reclassified several times based on ancestral or morphological characteristics. As a result, lots of confusion over the "official" scientific names.
