## Clownfish

_Amphiprion ocellaris_

Can be recognized by its vibrant orange body and large white bands, with small black separators between them

A type of anemonefish, they are immune to sea anemone's poison and use them as nests

```notes
I had to look up Nemo's dad's name. It's Marlin.

Several theories about how they can survive the sea anemone poison:

	1. Mucus of the fish may be based on sugars instead of proteins, meaning that the anemones fail to recognize the fish as a potential food source
	2. Simple evolution explanation, lol
